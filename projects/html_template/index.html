          <p>My love, my love<br /> 
            Remember the cries<br />
            When winter died for spring skies<br /> 
            They roared and roared<br /> 
            But we grabbed our seed<br /> 
            And sowed a song<br /> 
            Against their greed<br /> 
            And<br /> 
            Down in the vale<br /> 
            Hear the reaper swing, the reaper swing the reaper swing<br /> 
            Down in the vale<br /> 
            Hear the reaper sing<br /> 
            A tale of winter done<br /> 
            My son, my son<br /> 
            Remember the chains<br /> 
            When gold ruled with iron reins<br /> 
            We roared and roared<br /> 
            And twisted and screamed<br /> 
            For ours, a vale of better dreams</p>
