# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 31, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Forked and cloned repo, getting git(s) ready to go. Successfully configured both gitlab and github locally to work on both contract work and 100 Days.

**Thoughts**: It was really important to make sure I can do contract work for clients using gitlab while I'm going through this excercise and pushing regularly to my github account. Took some doing but I'm good to go. 

**Link(s) to work**: Be patient

### Day 1: April 1, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Starting simple, cranked out a simple html template to remind myself what bare bones really is

**Thoughts:** Start with what I feel confident in while I'm studying python further

**Link(s) to work**: [codepen](https://codepen.io/lance-hardy/pen/gbOZxVG)

### Day 2: April 2, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Decided to use the initial html_template project to expand on each day until I'm ready to dive into Python projects. Today I will be adding the ability to use scss and I'll use gulp to compile. Notes:

- npm init -y
- npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sass sass gulp-sourcemaps
  - gulp: Task runner.
  - gulp-sass: Compiles SCSS to CSS.
  - sass: Dart Sass compiler (required by gulp-sass).
  - gulp-sourcemaps: Generates sourcemaps for easier debugging in the browser.
- create gulpfile.js

**Thoughts:** This is a good evolution for this starting project. 

**Link(s) to work**: Wait for more significant changes. Progress in this log.
