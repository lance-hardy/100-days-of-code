# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 31, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Forked and cloned repo, getting git(s) ready to go. Successfully configured both gitlab and github locally to work on both contract work and 100 Days.

**Thoughts**: It was really important to make sure I can do contract work for clients using gitlab while I'm going through this excercise and pushing regularly to my github account. Took some doing but I'm good to go. 

**Link(s) to work**: Be patient

### Day 1: April 1, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Starting simple, cranked out a simple html template to remind myself what bare bones really is

**Thoughts:** Start with what I feel confident in while I'm studying python further
